# Python Disassembly

This repository contains work done when studying Python diassembly.
The Python version used for this is ``Python 3.8.2``.

The ``disassembler.py`` module implements certain routines that can
disassemble Python bytecode. It can also be used to disassemble Python
Cache (.pyc) files.
